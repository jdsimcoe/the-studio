Built on [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io/).

## Getting started

Make sure you have Node installed.

1. Install Node modules: `npm i`.
2. Spin up a local dev server by typing `npm run start`, `npm start` (if you are lazy), or `node build.js` if you are old school.
3. To deploy to a surge site of your choosing type `npm run deploy` after you have modified the deploy script in `package.json`.

## Hosting

We prefer/recommend/demand you use [Surge](https://surge.sh/) to deploy your projects. It is fast, secure, and brainless. Manual deploys can be triggered via an `npm` script: `npm run deploy`.

Have fun! ðŸ¤–
